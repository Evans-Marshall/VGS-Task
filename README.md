Built the form html in Brackets and saved to my local machine.

Realized that VGS already had a great JS/HTML form on their Git for just such a purpose.

Used XAMPP to create a local server and display it as the localhost 127.0.0.1

Next, I employed ngrok to create a secure https tunnel so that my html form would have access to the VGS server directly from by local machine.

I grabbed the local library link and identifier from my VGS dashboard and copied them to the local js code.

Next, I set up my inbound redacted and outbound revealed routes to their appropriate servers.

I then had a lot of fun typing in fake card numbers and testing the redaction.
